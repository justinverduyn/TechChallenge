# TechChallenge

This project uses Sqlite to create a database

1. Edit the TechContext.cs to put your DB in a place where you have permissions to create files.
2. If you don't have the dotnet-ef tool, install it with `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
3. Go to the TechChallenge folder and run `dotnet ef database update` to create your database
